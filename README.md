# SkinHouse2

I have a point light on the lamp, a directional light pointing down, a spotlight on the player, and an area light on the ground

The lighting has a toggle ssytem using the E button, which starts at off, then goes to dim, then on, and back to off again.

There is a particle emitter on the fridge to make it look like sparks are flying out of it

The video of the build is accesible under SkinHouse2/VideoSubmission.mp4
